# MTG-Card-Search-Web-form-
This web form was originally built for my store's pricing tool. TCGPlayer told me that I cannot access their API. I don't want a tool to simply look up card prices. I want more than that. So I've come here. I will place the code here.

This code is dirty. I am not a coder by profession. I own a card shop. I do IT as a day job. But I do not code. So please keep that in mind. I will do my best to tidy things up a bit.
