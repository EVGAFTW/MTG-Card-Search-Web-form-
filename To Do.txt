Restructure the lookup process:
-Empty page with 'Enter Card Name' and a single button 'Go!'.
	-Auto complete card name and format card name for APIs.
-Once posted, propagate set names for card in mention. Default 'Select Set'. Single Button 'Search!'
	-If default 'Select Set' is selected (Popup 'Please select the correct set.') reload page.
	-Format set names for image and price API (Need set list for TCGPlayer.) and pull data.
-Parse XML data and place relevant data in table under card image.
	-High, Med, Low and Foil prices (Foil not working on TCGTEST API key.)
	
Test using different cards. Split, promo and containing punctuation. 

Clean and modernize UI:
-Consistent color scheme.
-Responsive layout (Mobile ready.)
-Fast image resizing (Hosted image database W/lower quality & sized images.)

Form a card price database (Testing for deck building site. Future stuff.)
